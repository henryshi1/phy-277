# PHY 277 (Fall 2019), Stony Brook University
Programming course for Physics major. Emphasis on Numerical Analysis in FORTRAN and C++. 
All code edited in GNU Emacs and compiled using GCC compilers in Linux Ubuntu terminal environment.

# Assignment 1
Write your own version of the “Hello World!” program in Fortran 
(you may use the example in the lecture notes as a guide). 
Your code may output a message other than “Hello World!” 
provided that it is not an offensive messsage.

# Assignment 2
Write a Fortran program that
calculates the energy of a particle in MKS units. The program should prompt the user prompts the user to enter
the particle mass and speed in and output the particle kinetic energy to the terminal screen. In the header block
include a statement (in the comments) indicating what kinetic energy you found for a particle mass of 1 kilogram
and a speed of 10,000,000 meters per second. Also state if you are certain that your program is giving a correct
result for the particle kinetic energy.
